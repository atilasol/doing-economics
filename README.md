# Doing Economics â€“ CORE Econ

This repository contains my work on the [CORE Econ Doing Economics](https://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/index.html) project.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

[Doing Economics](https://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/index.html) is a collection of empirical projects that help students learn how to analyze data to answer real-world economic questions. Each project uses publicly available datasets and encourages hands-on engagement with economic research.
 
## ðŸ§  Why I'm Doing This

I'm using this repository to:
- Practice working with real-world economic data.
- Improve my Python and data analysis skills.
- Develop a deeper understanding of applied economics.
- Create a personal archive of annotated code and insights.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebooks
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and etc.
- Git & GitHub for version control

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

This is a personal learning project. I'm not affiliated with CORE Econ, and any errors or interpretations are my own.
